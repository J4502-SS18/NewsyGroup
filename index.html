<h1 class="header">Newsy Independent Study Program</h1>

<p id="body"> Newsy is the leadign video news network for a deeper understanding of the stories that matter. We deliver "news with the why" â€” providing the fresh perspective, no-hype delivery and added context that milennials seek.
</p>
<p id="body"> Newsy, with its significantly younger audience, stands apart from legacy cable news networks. While more than 70% of the cable news audience is over age 55, 80% of Newsy viewers on linear platforms are between 18-54. </p>
<p id="body"> Newsy students will have the opportunity to pitch and write stories and edit videos as part of a professor-led studet production team. They will recieve training in storytelling and video production from an industry-leading news organization. Following the program, students will have the chance to pursue opportunities at Newsy's bureaus in Columbia, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. </p>
